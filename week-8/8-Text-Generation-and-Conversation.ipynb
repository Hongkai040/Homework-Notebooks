While some may regard it as a parlour trick due to unpredictability, recent dramatic improvements in text generation suggest that these kind of models can find themselves being used in more serious social scientific applications, such as in survey design and construction, idiomatic translation, and the normalization of phrase and sentence meanings.\n",

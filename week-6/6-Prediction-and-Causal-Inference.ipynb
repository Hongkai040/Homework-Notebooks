    "# Week 6 - Prediction & Causal Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we covered the classification of text, such as classifying Reddit posts by thread topic. Classification often uses a representative sample of the text that we want to make inferences about, such as if we can human-code only a random sample of texts and then use ML to classify the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we talk about two different types of inferences to out-of-sample populations. _Text as Data_ defines _prediction_ by the question: \"What value of the outcome do we expect for a unit or units out of a distinct population of units?\" Often this is prediction for the future. We don't expect the weather today to be identical to the weather tomorrow, but it should contain some useful information. They define _causal inference_ by the question: \"How do outcomes differ if we intervene in the world?\" Causality is a deeply contested notion in science and philosophy, but it usually involves an \"if,\" a different between two counterfactual worlds, one where an event occurs and one where it doesn't.\n",

    "# Prediction\n",
    "We can make predictions about a range of different populations of texts. We can use texts in English to predict their translated version in French. We can use newspaper articles from 2012 to 2022 to predict 2023 newspaper articles (e.g., a [time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series)). Instead of forecasting, we can \"nowcast\" by using real-time social information such as Tweets to predict when an important event is happening, such as a riot.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don't have any information about how the new population will vary from the population we learned from, then prediction is implemented in the same way as in-sample inference. For example, if you have a categorization of 2022 emails as spam or not, you could predict whether 2023 emails are spam the same way you predicted 2022 emails. On the other hand, if you have new information, such as a trend beginning in December 2022 for spam emails to have \"Urgent:\" in the subject line, your 2023 prediction may differ by putting more weight on that indicator relative to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "We currently don't have code for this, because it's so similar to the classification last week, but we encourage you to think more about this if you're interested in predicting the future of your corpus!"

    "In causal inference, we are interested in the effect of a _treatment_ on an _outcome_. There are five sorts of variables that could be directly involved in our causal model, and any of them could be a text variable. This figure from [Keith et al. 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.474.pdf) concisely shows the five variables: treatment, mediator, outcome, confounder, and collider.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Text as treatment\" means the effect of text on other variables. For example, how does the news coverage of a politician affect their election chance? How does the sentiment of a Reddit post affect its upvotes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether we're interested in text as treatment, mediator, outcome, or confounder, we have at our disposal the same causal inference strategies used with other forms of data, such as matching, difference in difference, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variable. Each of these methods usually gives you a more precise identification of the causal effect than a plain regression. For example, one of the readings for this week, [Saha 2019](https://doi.org/10.1145/3292522.3326032), uses propensity score matching, which is a straightforward method that works on most datasets but has relatively weak identification. Some scholars such as Gary King advocate for an improved method, [coarsened exact matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvMyjDi4dyg). However, for this assignment, we do not go into these methods. We only use simple regressions. There are several courses at UChicago that introduce these methods, as well as online textbooks like Scott Cunningham's [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/), which is geared towards economists."

If we didn't, we might correctly find that the treatment and outcome are correlated, but rather than one causing the other, they could both be caused by a third variable. For example, if we are studying the effect of the journal a paper is published in on the citations of the paper, we may be worried that the text of the article affects both whether it is published by the journal and whether people cite it."
